# Hello!

I’m a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England. I started here in Sept 1998. I’m also an Honorary Professor of the [Computing Science Department](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/) at [Glasgow University](http://www.gla.ac.uk/), where I was a professor during 1990-1998.

I’m interested in the design, implementation, and application of lazy functional languages. In practical terms, that means I spend a most of my time on the design and implementation of [the language Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/). In particular, much of my work is focused around [the Glasgow Haskell Compiler](http://haskell.org/ghc), and its ramifications.

I am chair of [Computing at School](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/), the group at the epicentre of the reform of the national curriculum for Computing in England.  Computer science is now a foundational subject, alongside maths and natural science, that [every child learns from primary school onwards](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/3084).

I am married to Dorothy, a priest in the Church of England. We have six children.
