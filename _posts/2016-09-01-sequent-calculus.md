# Abstract
The lambda-calculus is popular as an intermediate language for practical compilers. But in the world of logic it has a lesser-known twin, born at the same time, called the _sequent calculus_. Perhaps that would be a good intermediate language, too? To explore this question we designed Sequent Core, a practically-oriented variant of sequent calculus, and used it to re-implement a substantial chunk of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
