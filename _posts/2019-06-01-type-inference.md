# Abstract
The Haskell compiler GHC includes a type inference engine for a rather sophisticated type system.  You might worry that a complicated type system leads to a very complicated type inference engine.   You’d be right, but we have learned a lot about how to structure type inference so that the complexity does not get out of control.

In this talk, given at [Zurihac 2019](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2019/), I explain how GHC’s type inference engine actually works by first _generating_ constraints and then _solving_ them.
