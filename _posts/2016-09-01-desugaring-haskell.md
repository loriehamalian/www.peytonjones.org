# Abstract
``Monads`` have taken the world by storm, and are supported by ``do``-notation (at least in Haskell). Programmers are increasingly waking up to the usefulness and ubiquity of ``Applicatives``, but they have so far been hampered by the absence of supporting notation. In this paper we show how to re-use the very same ``do``-notation to work for ``Applicatives`` as well, providing efficiency benefits for some types that are both ``Monad`` and ``Applicative``, and syntactic convenience for those that are merely ``Applicative``. The result is fully implemented in GHC, and is in use at Facebook to make it easy to write highly-parallel queries in a distributed system.
