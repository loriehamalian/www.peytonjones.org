# Abstract
The ability to perform type tests at runtime blurs the line between statically-typed and dynamically-checked languages. Recent developments in Haskellâ€™s type system allow even programs that use reflection to themselves be statically typed, using a type-indexed runtime representation of types called ``TypeRep``. As a result we can build dynamic types as an ordinary, statically-typed library, on top of ``TypeRep`` in an open-world context.
