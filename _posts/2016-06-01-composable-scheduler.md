# Abstract
The runtime for a modern, concurrent, garbage collected language like Haskell is like an operating system: sophisticated, complex, performant, but alas very hard to change. If more of the runtime system were in Haskell it would become far more modular and malleable. In this paper we describe a new concurrency design that allows the scheduler for concurrent and parallel programs to be written in Haskell. In particular, this substrate allows new primitives to be constructed _modularly_, obviating the need to re-engineer or reason about the interactions with GHCâ€™s existing concurrency support.
