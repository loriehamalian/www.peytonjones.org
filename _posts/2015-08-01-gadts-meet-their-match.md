# Abstract
For ML and Haskell, accurate warnings when a function definition has redundant or missing patterns are mission critical. But todayâ€™s compilers generate bogus warnings when the programmer uses guards (even simple ones), GADTs, pattern guards, or view patterns. We give the first algorithm that handles all these cases in a single, uniform framework, together with an implementation in GHC, and evidence of its utility in practice.
