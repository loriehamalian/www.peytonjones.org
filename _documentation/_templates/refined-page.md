<!-- A refined page is a standard page for the website. In particular, a refined page is used for pages that include images, videos, or other media than simply text and links. --> 

<!-- 1: To create a new refined page, create a new markdown file within the _pages folder. Make sure to include ".md" in the title to ensure the file is using the markdown format. -->

  <!-- In the markdown file, copy and paste the following metadata: -->

  ---
  <!--# layout -->
  title: "PAGE TITLE HERE"
  author_profile: true
  permalink: /link-here/
  header:
    overlay_image: /assets/images/spj-stock-header.jpg 
    overlay_filter: 0.5
---
  
   <!-- You can also copy this template and remove all of these comments around the metadata. --> 


<!-- 2: add your page content. -->

  <!-- The content of your page may vary, but you can add text using formatting in markdown,such as 
  Headers:
    # Header level 1
    ## Header level 2
    ### Header level 3
    #### Header level 4
  No octothropes for normal body paragraphs.

  **Bolding fonts** by using either double **astricks** or __double underscores__. You can *italicize fonts* using a single *astrick* or _underscore_. A word or phrase can be made _*bold and italic*_ by combining the above. You can use ***three astricks*** or ___three underscores___, or _*one of each*_. 

  To create block quotes, use a carrot. For example:
  > If this wasn't a comment, it would be in a block quote format.

  <!-- You can add links by [putting the text you want to link in brackets follow by the URL in parenthesis](https://URL HERE).

  <!-- You can add images by uploading the image to the assests/images/ folder within the repository, then linking to the image on the page. Example:
    ![Test favicon](/assets/images/favicon-32x32.png) -->
    
    <!-- If an image is hosted externally, it can be added using HTML code. Example: <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/583231?v=4" alt="Octocat" style="float: right; margin-right: 10px;" /> -->

  <!-- You can embbed videos by using the expression: {% include video id="EPGqzkEZWyw" provider="youtube" %} 
  This expression is used to embed a video from Youtube. The video ID in the above example is 'EPGqzkEZWyw'. This ID can be found on Youtube in a few differnet locations: in the video URL (after "watch?v=") or under "share", which creates a link such as "https://youtu.be/EPGqzkEZWyw". In this instance, the video ID is found after the backslash -->
