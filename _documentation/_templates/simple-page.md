<!-- A simple page is a standard page for the website. In particular, a simple page is used for pages that only include text and links. If your page needs to include more media, please view the template for a "refined page." --> 

<!-- 1: To create a simple page, create a new markdown file within the _pages folder. Make sure to include ".md" in the title to ensure the file is using the markdown format. -->

  <!-- In the markdown file, copy and paste the following metadata: -->

  ---
   <!--# layout -->
  title: "PAGE TITLE HERE"
  author_profile: true
  permalink: /link-here/
  header:
    overlay_image: /assets/images/spj-stock-header.jpg 
    overlay_filter: 0.5
  ---
  
   <!-- You can also copy this template and remove all of these comments around the metadata. --> 


<!-- 2: add your page content. -->

  <!-- The content of your page may vary, but you can add text using formatting in markdown,such as 
  Headers:
    # Header level 1
    ## Header level 2
    ### Header level 3
    #### Header level 4
  No octothropes for normal body paragraphs.

  **Bolding fonts** by using either double **astricks** or __double underscores__. You can *italicize fonts* using a single *astrick* or _underscore_. A word or phrase can be made _*bold and italic*_ by combining the above. You can use ***three astricks*** or ___three underscores___, or _*one of each*_. 

  To create block quotes, use a carrot. For example:
  > If this wasn't a comment, it would be in a block quote format.
