abstract = {We describe a library-based approach to constructing termination tests suitable for controlling termination of symbolic methods such as partial evaluation, supercompilation and theorem proving. With our combinators, all termination tests are correct by construction. We show how the library can be designed to embody various optimisations of the termination tests, which the user of the library takes advantage of entirely transparently.},
