abstract = {We show how to compile high-level functional array-processing programs, drawn from image processing and machine learning, into C code that runs as fast as hand-written C.Â  The key idea is to transform the program to destination passing style, which in turn enables a highly-efficient stack-like memory allocation discipline.},
