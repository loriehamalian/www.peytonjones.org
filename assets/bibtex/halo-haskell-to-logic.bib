abstract = {Even well-typed programs can go wrong in modern functional languages, by encountering a pattern-match failure, or simply returning the wrong answer. An increasingly-popular response is to allow programmers to write contracts that express semantic properties, such as crash-freedom or some useful post-condition. We study the static verification of such contracts. Our main contribution is a novel translation to first-order logic of both Haskell programs, and contracts written in Haskell, all justified by denotational semantics. This translation enables us to prove that functions satisfy their contracts using an off-the-shelf first-order logic theorem prover.},
